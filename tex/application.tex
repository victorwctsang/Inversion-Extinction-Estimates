In this chapter, we discuss the results of applying the proposed MINMI and SI-RM estimators to real datasets to demonstrate their use to palaeobiologists, comparing their estimates to estimates found using existing methods such as: the uncorrected version of GRIWM with $q=0.05$, the bias-adjusted version of GRIWM (GRIWM-BA) with $q=0.5$, and the SI-UGM estimator. We investigate the performance of point estimates and confidence intervals constructed by the various methods and compare their performance and ease of use to the results from the simulation studies.

We applied these three methods to 4 fossil records of megafauna believed to have gone extinct in the Late Pleistocene era/early Holocene period: the steppe bison (\textit{Bison Priscus}), the cave bear (\textit{Ursus spelaeus}), the cave hyena (Crocuta spelaea) and the Eurasian woolly mammoth (\textit{Mammuthus primigenius}). We also investigate the results for the cave bear more closely to place our methods in context of the literature.

\section{Setup}

Under the \hyperref[model: measurement-error]{$\varepsilon$-model}, some choices of values need to made. One such choice is the value of $K$ --- since the speciation and invasion dates of the species are not known, $K$ was set to the age of the oldest observation in each dataset, reducing the number of observations used for estimation to $n-1$. Another choice is the amount of measurement error variation, which was set by taking the average standard error in each dataset. These have been summarised in \autoref{tab:table-applications-Ks}.

One difficulty when applying the SI-UGM estimator is the choice of $\bm{\theta}$, the vector of candidate values for $\theta$. Broadly speaking, as long as $\bm{\theta}$ has a wide enough range with enough values such that all plausible values of theta can be covered, we can be confident of getting reasonably accurate estimate (albeit at the cost of requiring more computation). However, there is currently no precise process for choosing this range and number of values. For the purpose of illustrating how to apply this method, we select $\bm{\theta}$ using the same process as the simulation studies, setting it equal to a vector of length 5000 with the elements taken from the set of equally spaced numbers from 10 standard deviations below the BA-MLE to 2 standard deviations above. (see \autoref{tab:table-applications-Ks}).

\end{table}

When choosing the number of Monte Carlo samples, $B$, to use in the MINMI method, we aimed for a $B > 100$ that would give estimates with Monte Carlo error variance less than 20\% of $\sigma^2$. However, when solving for $B$ using \autoref{eqn:minmi-optimal-b}, all values found were less than 10 for the four datasets. As such, 100 Monte Carlo samples were used in each application.

Finally, 1000 iterations were used for the SI-RM estimator. Initially, we attempted to use a similar process to MINMI, setting a target variance $A$ and iterating until the estimated SI-RM variance was less than $A$. However, this resulted in early termination of the RM process, which would last only 2 steps across all four applications for $A  = 0.2*\sigma$, and only 5 steps for $A = 0.1*\sigma$. This suggests that our estimate of the variance at iteration $i$ is inexact at small $i$. Ultimately, due to time constraints we were unable to resolve this issue, and arbitrarily chose to use 1000 iterations, at which point we identified convergence.

\section{Results}

The methods produced comparable confidence intervals, with similar widths, ranges, and point estimates. These results are consistent with our simulation experiments: the MINMI, SI-RM, and SI-UGM estimators produced confidence intervals that are typically wider than those found by both the uncorrected and corrected versions of GRIWM.

\end{figure}

Another observation of note is the different widths of the intervals for each dataset. One reason for this difference is due to the sample size: for instance, the intervals for the Steppe Bison, where $n = 13$, are substantially wider than those for the Eurasian Woolly Mammoth where $n = 194$. This can be interpreted as being due to the availability of more information contributing to more precise estimates, and therefore narrower confidence intervals. Another reason may be due to the 

\section{Case Study: Cave Bear (\textit{Ursus spelaeus})}

To put our results in context, we considered the cave bear as an example of extinct megafauna from the Pleistocene era and compared our results to those obtained by \citet{Baca2016}, who estimated extinction times using a dataset of over 200 fossils. Unfortunately, we were unable to get access to the dataset used in the paper, instead using the dataset from \citet{Cooper2015} containing 30 samples.

Having disappeared towards the end of the last glacial period, the cave bear's causes of extinction and precise extinction time have been in debate over the years. In their 2016 study, \citet{Baca2016} used the original implementation of GRIWM estimator with threshold probability $q = 0.05$ to construct 95\% confidence intervals for the extinction time, concluding that extinction likely occurred between $25,234 - 24,291$ calendar years before present (BP). The authors also considered a more conservative approach, excluding younger dates that were missing certain chemical data. This resulted in more conservative estimates of between $27,007 - 26,117$ years BP \cite{Baca2016}.

For our analysis, we used a different dataset of cave bear fossils, obtained from \citet{Cooper2015}. This dataset had 30 samples with the youngest sample dated to approximately $27,832$ years BP, compared to the dataset of 207 used by \citet{Baca2016} with the youngest sample dated to approximately $26,000$ years BP. Using the MINMI, SI-RM, and SI-UGM methods, we constructed confidence intervals that suggest extinction occurred between $29,166 - 26,900$ years BP.
\begin{table}[ht]

    \caption{Table of estimated intervals and widths for the cave bear. Note that \citet{Baca2016} used the original implementation of GRIWM with $q=0.05$ and the ``conservative" estimate was found using a subset of their data. Estimates for MINMI, SI-RM, and GRIWM-BA were found using the dataset from \citet{Cooper2015}.}

    \label{tab:case-study-intervals}
    \vspace{-4mm}
\end{table}

The intervals estimated by \citet{Baca2016} using GRIWM are narrower than those estimated by the MINMI and SI-RM methods (\autoref{tab:case-study-intervals}). One reason is the fact that our dataset is significantly smaller --- a smaller sample size means estimates have greater uncertainty, and thus we can expect wider intervals. Additionally, our simulation study results are consistent with this application, as the estimates using both the original and bias-adjusted implementations of GRIWM consistently yielded narrower intervals.

    \label{fig:application-cave-bear}
\end{figure}

Another difference in our results is the interval estimated, as the periods estimated by \citet{Baca2016} are clearly more recent than those estimated by MINMI and SI-RM (\autoref{fig:application-cave-bear}). This is likely due to \citet{Baca2016} having used the original implementation of GRIWM with $q = 0.05$, which we found to be downwards biased due to the bias present introduced by the recovery rate from \citet{Mcinerny2006} as well as the choice of threshold probability $q=0.05$. Another reason is related to the datasets used: the youngest sample in the dataset used by \citet{Baca2016} was approximately 1000 years more recent than the youngest sample in the dataset we used, contributing to their estimated confidence intervals being more recent.
