\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose two inversion-based methods for inference of extinction times in the fossil record: the MINMI estimator, a novel approach that direct accounts for measurement error and sampling error; and the SI-RM estimator, an application of the Robbins-Monro process to this problem.
    \item This problem is important because most methods for estimating extinction times in the fossil record do not account for radiometric error or aare not able to accommodate for non-uniformly distributed fossils. This means estimates of extinction times may be significantly biased or imprecise, meaning the causes and timings of extinctions may be incorrectly estimated.
    \item \textit{brief outline of MINMI}
    \item \textit{brief outline of SI-RM}
    \item Under known conditions, we found that MINMI and SI-RM both produce estimates with better coverage than existing methods at a fraction of the computational cost.
