%     \caption{Sample variance of $\hat\theta_q$ (shown in \textcolor{red}{red}) plotted against the expected variance according to the asymptotic approximation (shown in \textcolor{blue}{blue}) on log-scales for both the $x$ and $y$ axes. The approximate variance obtained from the delta method approaches the sample variance as $B$ grows large; although the approximate variance tends to underestimate the variance (as indicated by the sample variance) for small $B$. Note the differences in the $x$ and $y$ axes; $\Var(\hat\theta_q)$ tends to grow disproportionately as $q$ becomes small.}
