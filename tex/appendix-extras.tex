The approximate variance obtained from the delta method approaches the sample variance as $B$ grows large; although the approximate variance tends to underestimate the variance (as indicated by the sample variance) for small $B$. Note the differences in the $x$ and $y$ axes; $\Var(\hat\theta_q)$ tends to grow disproportionately as $q$ becomes small.}

Interestingly, as measurement error increased in magnitude, \textbf{MLE became more accurate}, likely due to the fact that measurement error is negatively skewed since they cannot be greater than $K-\theta$ (see \autoref{fig: minmi_integral}). This means that as we increase the size of our measurement errors, the observed minimum becomes more likely to be less than $\theta$, which tends to cancel out with the positive bias of the MLE and produce fairly good estimates. Logically, this means the \textbf{MLE's estimates are much more varied}, which we can clearly see in \autoref{tab:table-sim-exp-point-error2} as it has the greatest sample variance.
