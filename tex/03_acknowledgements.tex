\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

{\bigskip} First, I'd like to acknowledge and pay respect to the Wangal people, the Traditional Custodians of the land on which majority of this thesis was written on, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present.

{\bigskip} My greatest gratitude and thanks goes to my supervisor, Professor David Warton. Without a doubt, this year would not have been possible without his endless guidance, wisdom, and patience. It was an honour to be under his tutelage this year and absorb so much knowledge from a (literal!) giant.

{\bigskip} I'd also like to thank the Eco-Stats lab for welcoming me with open arms. The weekly meetings are always an excellent learning opportunity and I always looked forward to them. The last couple weeks would have also been much more stressful without all the advice, and the motivation from horror stories of last-minute thesis submissions really kept me on track!

{\bigskip} Finally, an enormous thank you must be said to my friends, family, and loved ones for their support and encouragement. And special thanks to Coco for her love, always.
