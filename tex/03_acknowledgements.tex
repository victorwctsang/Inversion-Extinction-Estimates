\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

{\bigskip} First, I'd like to acknowledge and pay respect to the Wangal people, the Traditional Custodians of the land on which majority of this thesis was written on, and pay my respects to their Elders past and present.

{\bigskip} My greatest gratitude and thanks goes to my supervisor, Professor David Warton. Without a doubt, this year would not have been possible without his endless guidance, wisdom, and patience. It was an \textit{honour} to study under his tutelage this year, and absorb so much knowledge from a (literal!) giant.

{\bigskip} I'd also like to thank the Eco-Stats lab for welcoming me with open arms and sharing their experiences, tips, and advice. The last couple weeks would have been much more stressful if I hadn't received early motivation from the horror stories of last-minute thesis submissions.

{\bigskip} Finally, an enormous ``thank you" goes to my friends, family, and loved ones for their support and encouragement. In particular, a big shout out to my parents who continued to encourage this endeavour in spite of my inability to explain the thesis in Chinese. And special thanks to Coco for her love and support; thanks for patiently allowing me to indulge in overly-detailed and out-of-context elaborations about eco-stats and fossils.
