\begin{enumerate}
    \item We have proposed two inversion-based methods for estimating extinction times: MINMI, a novel approach; and SI-RM, a novel application of the Robbins Monro process to this problem
    \item MINMI is faster and produces CI's with better coverage than existing methods in the literature (like GRIWM/SI-RM) under uniformity assumptions. This is true for all levels of measurement error
    \item SI-RM produces CI's with better coverage than existing methods, with added flexibility as the simulation model can be adjusted to fit the data better
    \item MINMI still has a ways to go: monotonically increasing property still needs to be shown in general; still need to explore relaxing the uniform assumption
    \item We applied MINMI and SI-RM to real datasets of calibrated megafauna fossil ages and found that they work faster with results that are just as good/are consistent with the literature
    \item Code for this thesis is available on github?
