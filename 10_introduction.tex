\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Problem introduction}: estimating confidence intervals for extinction times and dealing with fossil recovery \& measurement error assumptions
    \item Estimating extinction time is interesting and difficult
    \item Why is it difficult?
    \item Measurement error and fossil recovery rate are things
    \item Measurement error shows up in other settings and scenarios too
    \item Summary of background research/lit review
    \item Summary of proposed methods
    \item Summary of results, conclusions, and future work
\end{itemize}
